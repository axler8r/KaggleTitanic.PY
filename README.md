# Kaggle Titanic Competition
Multiple implementations of the Titanic competition on Kaggle.

## Technologies
The following technologies were used in the project:
+ Python
+ Elixir

Over time, more technologies may be added. I am interested in exploring Julia
and perhaps R.

#### Python
The Python implementation uses the following libraries:
+ `polars` for data manipulation
+ `numpy` for numerical operations
+ `ski-learn` for decision tree classifier
+ `xgboost` for gradient boosting classifier
+ `pytorch` for neural network classifier
+ `seaborn` for plotting

#### Elixir
The Elixir implementation uses the following libraries:
+ `explorer` for data manipulation
+ `nx` for numerical operations
+ `scholar` for decision tree classifier
+ `exgboost` for gradient boosting classifier
+ `axon` for neural network classifier
+ `vega` for plotting

## Directory Structure
The directory structure is self explanatory.
